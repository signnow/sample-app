# ISV with Form and One Click Send - Merge Fields

This sample demonstrates how to create a document group from a document group template, process merge fields by adding permanent text elements, and send invites to multiple recipients with different roles. The sample showcases SignNow SDK integration for document group management, merge field processing using DocumentPut, and automated invite sending.

## Use Case Overview

This sample addresses the common business scenario where ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) need to:
- Collect customer information through a web form
- Create documents from templates with merge fields
- Process merge fields by adding permanent, read-only text elements at field coordinates
- Send documents to multiple recipients with different roles
- Track signing status and provide download functionality

The sample is particularly useful for businesses that need to automate document workflows with multiple signers and merge field processing using permanent text elements.

## Scenario Description

The sample implements a complete document workflow where:

1. **Customer Information Collection**: Users fill out a form with customer name, company name, and email
2. **Document Creation**: A document group is created from a template with merge fields
3. **Merge Fields Processing**: Customer and company names are added as permanent, read-only text elements at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut, making them part of the document content
4. **Recipient Assignment**: Different recipients are assigned based on roles with specific email addresses
5. **Invite Sending**: Documents are automatically sent to all recipients
6. **Status Tracking**: Users can monitor signing progress and download completed documents

### Step-by-step:

1. **Form Page**: User enters customer name, company name, and email address
2. **Document Group Creation**: Backend creates a document group from the specified template
3. **Merge Fields Processing**: Customer and company names are added as permanent text elements at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut, making them part of the document content
4. **Recipient Configuration**: 
   - "Prepare Contract" role gets the email from the form
   - "Customer to Sign" role gets a specific test email address
5. **Invite Sending**: Documents are sent to all recipients automatically
6. **Status Page**: User is redirected to status page to monitor progress
7. **Download**: Completed documents can be downloaded as merged PDF

## Technical Flow

| Action | Responsibility | Code Location |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Form submission | Frontend | `index.blade.php` - `initFormPage()` |
| Document group creation | Backend | `SampleController.php` - `createDocumentGroupFromTemplate()` |
| Merge fields processing | Backend | `SampleController.php` - `processMergeFields()` |
| Invite sending | Backend | `SampleController.php` - `sendInvite()` |
| Status tracking | Backend | `SampleController.php` - `getDocumentGroupSignersStatus()` |
| Document download | Backend | `SampleController.php` - `downloadDocumentGroupFile()` |

## Sequence of Function Calls

1. **Frontend Form Submission**:
   - User submits form with customer data
   - Frontend sends POST request to `/api/samples/ISVWithFormAndOneClickSendMergeFields`
   - Action: `prepare_dg`

2. **Backend Document Group Creation**:
   - `prepareDocumentGroup()` - Main orchestration method
   - `createDocumentGroupFromTemplate()` - Creates document group from template
   - `processMergeFields()` - Processes merge fields by adding permanent text elements using DocumentPut

   - `sendInvite()` - Sends invites to all recipients

3. **Frontend Status Page**:
   - User redirected to status page with document group ID
   - `initStatusPage()` - Initializes status tracking
   - `updateStatuses()` - Polls for signing status
   - Download functionality available when documents are complete

## Template Info

- **Template Type**: Document Group Template
- **Template ID**: `8e36720a436041ea837dc543ec00a3bc3559df45`
- **Template Name**: Sales Proposal
- **Merge Fields Processing**:
  - `CustomerName` - Converted to permanent text element at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut
  - `CompanyName` - Converted to permanent text element at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut
- **Recipient Roles**:
  - "Prepare Contract" - Email from form
  - "Customer to Sign" - Specific test email address

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
SIGNNOW_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SIGNNOW_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SIGNNOW_USERNAME=your_username
SIGNNOW_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Setup Instructions

1. Configure SignNow API credentials in your environment
2. Ensure the document group template exists and is accessible
3. Verify the merge field names match the template fields
4. The sample uses a hardcoded test email for "Customer to Sign" role

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. **Access the sample**: Navigate to `/samples/ISVWithFormAndOneClickSendMergeFields`
2. **Fill the form**: Enter customer name, company name, and email
3. **Submit**: Click "Send Documents" to create and send documents
4. **Monitor**: Check status page for signing progress
5. **Download**: Download completed documents when all signatures are complete

**Expected Flow**:
```
Form Page ‚Üí Document Creation ‚Üí Merge Fields Processing ‚Üí Invite Sending ‚Üí Status Page ‚Üí Download
```

## Page Flow Documentation

### HTML Container Pages

1. **Form Page** (`<div id="form-page">`)
   - **Purpose**: Collect customer information
   - **Fields**: Customer Name, Company Name, Email (all required)
   - **Action**: Submit form to create document group and send invites
   - **Transition**: Redirects to status page after successful submission

2. **Status Page** (`<div id="status-page">`)
   - **Purpose**: Monitor signing progress and download completed documents
   - **Features**: Real-time status polling, download functionality
   - **Data Source**: Document group ID passed via query parameter
   - **Completion**: Notifies parent application when download is initiated

### Page Navigation Flow

- **Form Page ‚Üí Status Page**: Direct navigation via `?page=status-page&document_group_id=123`
- **Status Page Updates**: AJAX polling for real-time status updates
- **Download Flow**: Direct file download with parent notification

### Data Passing Between Pages

- **Form Data**: Passed via POST request to backend
- **Document Group ID**: Passed via query parameter to status page
- **Status Data**: Retrieved via AJAX calls from backend
- **Download Data**: Streamed directly from backend to browser

## Technical Implementation Details

### Merge Fields Processing

The sample processes merge fields by:
1. **Identifying merge fields**: Locates `CustomerName` and `CompanyName` fields in documents
2. **Creating text elements**: Adds permanent text elements at merge field coordinates using DocumentPut
3. **Preserving other fields**: Maintains all other fields in the document
4. **Making content permanent**: Text elements become part of the document and cannot be modified by signers

### Recipient Email Assignment

The sample assigns emails based on recipient roles:
- **"Prepare Contract"**: Uses email from the form
- **"Customer to Sign"**: Uses a specific test email address for demonstration

### DocumentPut Implementation

The sample uses DocumentPut to:
- Create permanent text elements at merge field coordinates
- Preserve document structure and other fields
- Make merge field content part of the document itself
