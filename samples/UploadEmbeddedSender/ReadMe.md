# Upload Embedded Sender

This sample demonstrates uploading a PDF file to SignNow and creating an embedded sending link for document preparation and sending.

## Use Case Overview

This sample showcases how to:
- Upload a PDF document to SignNow using the API
- Create a document group from the uploaded document
- Generate an embedded sending link for document preparation (edit mode)
- Track document status and provide download functionality

**Target Audience**: Developers who need to implement document upload functionality with embedded sending capabilities.

## Scenario Description

This sample implements a workflow where users can upload a PDF document and create an embedded sending link for document preparation and sending. The workflow consists of two main pages:

### Step-by-step:

1. **User opens the page** ‚Äî The application automatically starts the upload process and shows a loading spinner
2. **Document upload** ‚Äî The PDF file is uploaded to SignNow using the API
3. **Document group creation** ‚Äî A document group is created from the uploaded document
4. **Embedded sending link generation** ‚Äî An embedded sending link is created for document preparation (edit mode)
5. **Document preparation** ‚Äî User is redirected to SignNow interface to prepare and send the document (add recipients and fields)
6. **Status tracking** ‚Äî User returns to status page to monitor document progress
7. **Document download** ‚Äî User can download the completed document when ready

### Page Flow Documentation

#### HTML Container Pages:
1. **Form Page** (`<div id="form-page">`): Shows loading spinner and automatically starts the upload process
2. **Status Page** (`<div id="status-page">`): Shows document status and provides download functionality

#### Embedded SignNow Pages:
- **Embedded Sending (Edit Mode)**: External SignNow URL for document preparation and sending (redirects back to status page)

### Page Navigation Flow:
```
Form Page ‚Üí Embedded Sending (Edit Mode) ‚Üí Status Page
```

- **Form Page**: Automatically uploads document and creates embedded sending link, shows loading spinner
- **Embedded Sending (Edit Mode)**: SignNow interface for document preparation and sending (external URL) - allows users to add recipients and fields
- **Status Page**: Shows document status and provides download when complete

## Technical Flow

| Action | Responsibility | Code Location |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Upload PDF file | Backend uploads file to SignNow | `uploadDocument()` method |
| Create document group | Backend creates group from uploaded document | `createDocumentGroup()` method |
| Generate embedded sending link | Backend creates embedded URL (edit mode) | `createEmbeddedSendingUrl()` method |
| Track status | Backend polls for document status | `getDocumentGroupSignersStatus()` method |
| Download completed document | Backend provides merged PDF | `downloadDocumentGroupFile()` method |

## Sequence of Function Calls

### Frontend-Backend Interaction Flow:

1. **Page Load**:
   - Frontend automatically sends POST to `/api/samples/UploadEmbeddedSender` with action `upload_and_create_dg`
   - Backend calls `uploadAndCreateDocumentGroup()` method

2. **Document Upload Process**:
   - `uploadDocument()` - Uploads PDF file to SignNow
   - `createDocumentGroup()` - Creates document group from uploaded document
   - `createEmbeddedSendingUrl()` - Generates embedded sending link (edit mode)

3. **Embedded Sending (Edit Mode)**:
   - Frontend redirects to embedded sending URL
   - User prepares and sends document in SignNow interface (can add recipients and fields)
   - SignNow redirects back to status page with document group ID

4. **Status Tracking**:
   - Frontend sends POST with action `invite-status`
   - Backend calls `getDocumentGroupSignersStatus()` to get current status
   - Frontend displays status and provides download functionality

5. **Document Download**:
   - Frontend sends POST with action `download-doc-group`
   - Backend calls `downloadDocumentGroupFile()` to get merged PDF
   - Frontend triggers download and notifies parent application

### Page Navigation Sequence:

1. **Frontend Page Routing**: `handlePages()` function manages page visibility
2. **Backend Redirect URL Construction**: Embedded sending URL includes redirect to status page
3. **SignNow API Calls**: Document upload, document group creation, embedded sending link generation
4. **Return Flow**: Embedded sending redirects back to status page with document group ID

## Template Info

This sample uses a pre-existing PDF file (`samples/UploadEmbeddedSender/Sales Proposal.pdf`) for demonstration purposes. The file is automatically uploaded to SignNow when the page loads.

In a real implementation, you would:
- Allow users to upload their own PDF files
- Implement file validation and size limits
- Handle different file formats if needed

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
- `SIGNNOW_CLIENT_ID` - Your SignNow API client ID
- `SIGNNOW_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your SignNow API client secret
- `SIGNNOW_USERNAME` - Your SignNow account username
- `SIGNNOW_PASSWORD` - Your SignNow account password

### Setup Instructions:
1. The PDF file is already included in the sample directory (`samples/UploadEmbeddedSender/Sales Proposal.pdf`)
2. Configure SignNow API credentials in your environment
3. Make sure the application has proper file permissions

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. **Access the sample**: Navigate to `/samples/UploadEmbeddedSender`
2. **Wait for processing**: The page automatically uploads the PDF and creates an embedded sending link
3. **Use embedded sending (edit mode)**: Click the link to prepare and send the document (add recipients and fields)
4. **Check status**: Return to the status page to monitor progress
5. **Download document**: Download the completed document when ready

**Expected Flow**: Page Load ‚Üí Embedded Sending (Edit Mode) ‚Üí Status Page ‚Üí Download
