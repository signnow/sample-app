# Embedded Signer Sample Application: EmbeddedSignerWithFormInsurance

## Use Case Overview

This sample application demonstrates how to implement an **Embedded Signer With Form** workflow using the SignNow API. The app guides users through a seamless process of filling out, signing, and downloading a **Medical Insurance Claim Form**. This workflow is designed to enhance user experience by pre-filling user information and providing an intuitive interface for document signing and downloading.

## Scenario: Embedded Signer With Form

### Step-by-step:

1. **User opens the form** ‚Äî The application displays a simple web form requesting the user's name (required) and email (optional).
2. **User submits the form** ‚Äî Upon submission, a document is cloned from a preloaded template, and fields are pre-filled with the user's input.
3. **Embedded signing session** ‚Äî An embedded signing link is generated and opened within the app for the user to sign the document.
4. **Redirect to the completion screen** ‚Äî After signing, the user is redirected to a "Thank You" page.
5. **Download option** ‚Äî The user is given the option to download the signed PDF document.

## Technical Flow

1. **GET Request Initiation**
    - The initial form is displayed if the page is accessed without a `page` parameter.
    - If accessed with `?page=download-container`, the download screen is shown.

2. **Template Cloning**
    - The document template cannot be sent for signing directly.
    - It must first be **cloned** to create a **signable document**.
    - The document is cloned from a **preloaded template** in our **demo SignNow account** using TemplateId: `'c78e902aa6834af6ba92e8a6f92b603108e1bbbb'`.

3. **Field Prefilling**
    - The cloned document is pre-filled with values from the submitted form (`Name`, `Email`).
    - These values populate the fields in the document before the signing session begins.

4. **Embedded Invite Creation**
    - To generate an embedded signing link, the app performs the following:
        - Fetches the role ID from the cloned document.
        - Creates an **embedded invite** specifically for the signing session.

5. **Signing Link Generation**
    - An embedded signing link is generated.
    - A redirect URL is appended to ensure the user is taken to the finish page after signing.

6. **Document Download**
    - On the "Thank You" page, the user can click a button to download the signed PDF.
    - A `POST` request is sent with the `document_id` to the server.
    - The app fetches the signed PDF and initiates the download.

## Technical Considerations

- **Template Cloning**: Each user interaction results in a unique, signable document cloned from a static template.
- **Field Prefilling**: Reduces manual input by using user-provided data to pre-fill the document.
- **Embedded Invite**: Ensures a seamless signing process within the application.
- **Security and Adaptation**: This flow is designed for demonstration purposes and should be adapted and secured appropriately for production use.
