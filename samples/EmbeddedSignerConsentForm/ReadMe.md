# Embedded Signer Sample: Consent Form for Dinosaur Grooming

## Use Case Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use the SignNow REST API without the PHP SDK to implement an Embedded Signer workflow. In this flow, the user signs a pre-defined Consent Form within your application and is then redirected to a confirmation screen where they can download the completed document.

This specific example simulates a scenario where a dinosaur owner provides consent for various grooming services by signing a digital liability waiver and service agreement.

## Scenario: Embedded Signer Without Form

### Step-by-step:
1. **User opens the signing page** ‚Äî The app redirects them to the embedded signing session.
2. **User signs the document** ‚Äî The embedded interface allows them to sign directly within the app.
3. **Redirect to finish screen** ‚Äî After signing, the user is redirected to a "Thank You" page.
4. **Download option** ‚Äî The user can download the completed PDF.

## Technical Flow

1. **GET Request Initiation**
    - Route is accessed with or without a `page` query parameter.
    - If `page=download-container`, it shows the "Thank You" view with a download button.
    - Otherwise, the flow initiates an embedded signing session:
        - Clones a predefined template (see below).
        - Creates an embedded invite for a single signer.
        - Generates a secure signing link.
        - Redirects the user to the embedded signing session.

2. **Template Cloning**
   - A **template** cannot be used directly for signing.
   - It must first be **cloned** to create a **document** instance that can be signed.
   - The document is cloned from a **preloaded template** on our **demo SignNow account**

3. **Embedded Invite Generation**
    - In order to get an **embedded invite link**, an **embedded invite** must be explicitly created.
    - The app retrieves the signer's role ID from the cloned document.
    - An invite is created and assigned to the signer's email.

4. **Signing Link Generation**
    - A signing link is generated using `DocumentInviteLinkPost`, and the redirect URL is appended.
    - The user is redirected to this link for signing.

5. **POST Request for Download**
    - After signing, the user is redirected to the `download-container` view.
    - Clicking the download button sends a `POST` request with the `document_id`.
    - The app fetches the signed PDF and sends it to the user for download.

## Notes
- The template ID used in this demo: 3d28c78de8ec43ccab81a3e7dde07925cb5a1d29.
- The template is a "Beauty Procedures Consent Form" for Luxe Dinosaur Grooming Salon.
- Signer's email is pulled from config: config('signnow.api.signer_email').
- All API requests are made via direct HTTP requests using Guzzle with credentials from the .env file.
